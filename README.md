### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

All my experience initially lies in B2B sales, where I progressed from a manager to a business development lead for international markets (APAC countries). I successfully developed a new business line within the company, from formulating the strategy to acquiring the first leads. During this journey, I discovered my passion for working with data and the immense analytical insights it can provide to businesses. Consequently, I decided to pursue a career in data analytics and enrolled in a Data Analytics program at Yandex.Praktikum.

- Now, I am proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, BI tools, statistics, and have a fundamental understanding of A/B testing. I plan to continue developing my expertise in this field further. I believe that my previous experience in B2B can add significant value, as it has equipped me with substantial expertise and honed my soft skills.

- Currently, I reside in the Netherlands and primarily positions within my local area or remote work opportunities
